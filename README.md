# Multiagent_ytchannel_rag_and_blog_writer
this project uses crewai to make a multi agent intercummnicating system that takes your query and the yt channel you entered, searches your query through every video of said YT cahnnel and then writes a blogpost about your query.
You will need an OPENAI API key for vector embedding of the transcripts of the yt videos and your entered queries.
this project works in the terminal itself and I have not yet made a frontend for it.
